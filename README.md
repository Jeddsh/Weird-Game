# Weird-Game
A little game I made for an IA in IBCS3

A project that used the many diffrent concepts and data structuresearned in my 4 years at high school to create my Idea for potential startegey game.

# The Objective #
get to the other sides base and capture it!
  
# How to play #
Click the unit to see where it can move
Click the square you want to move to move your units
If a unit is on the square you want to move to you can attack it by clicking the Square its on
  -Note: if your unit doesn't defeat the other one on its inital attack, the other unit will counter attack, damaging you back.
Click the base to spawn units
End Turn to... end your turn

Other Notes:
This is a bare bones concept of what this could potentially look like.
updates that are planned include: 
  - option for single player mode and 2 player mode
  - more units in the base game with diffrent stats to add a better level of strategy
  - randomly generated obstacles like trees and rocks that both hinder movement and add economy points 
  - bigger board of squares to fit other structures like villages to produce more units from
